DESCRIPTION

This is a java application based on Socket Programming, where communication is established using the concept of 3 way
handshaking. This 3-way handshaking is used so that both ends can initiate and negotiate separate TCP socket connections 
at the same time. The server acts as a middleware between the two clients.
